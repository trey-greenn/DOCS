## 5. Shared Modules

**Purpose:**
- Define types, constants, and configurations used by both frontend & backend
- Ensures type safety and single source of truth for common definitions
- Reduces duplication and maintains consistency across the stack
- Simplifies API contract maintenance between frontend and backend

**Structure:**
```
shared/
â”œâ”€â”€ types/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth.ts         # Authentication related types
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ chat.ts         # Chat and message interfaces
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user.ts         # User profile interfaces
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ compliance.ts   # Compliance domain models
â”œâ”€â”€ constants/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ endpoints.ts    # API endpoint paths
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ errors.ts       # Error codes and messages
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts       # Shared configuration values
â””â”€â”€ utils/
    â”œâ”€â”€ validation.ts   # Shared validation logic
    â”œâ”€â”€ formatting.ts   # Date/time/currency formatting
    â””â”€â”€ testing.ts      # Test utilities
```

**Examples:**
